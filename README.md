## Description

A Node application that takes user input to prompts and creates a markdown file in a professional README format. This makes it that much easier to create a README.md for your project in a professional format. It can help someone not familiar with the proper format or just save time. I created this application to practice Node and creating an application without a front end that can be ran in the terminal.
